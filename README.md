The Devil's Dungeon (c) 1977 C. William Engel

Your first question may be, "Why?" 

There are two answers to that question. The short answer is, "Because I am crazy."

The longer answer has a lot to do with history and I'll leave that alone for now.

Some important notes:
1) This is a Python 3 version, in the sense that it was brought over almost verbatim from the BASIC listing. I only
used Python specific code when it made sense to (or, more accurately, I knew what it was). 
2) The BASIC version used a lot of GOTO statements to skip over parts, rather than creating subroutines (there is a 
total of 1 subroutine in the original listing). This creates areas where mental gymnastics is needed to fit a language  where you 
can't arbitrarily go to whatever line you feel like. 
3) Despite having read the BASIC listing numerous times, I don't actually know how this game works. Or, rather, I know the
"what" (most of the time), but not the "why". Like, why are there arrays to set flags? Well, that makes sense. But I don't
know why they're multiplied together when an AND would do (and most BASICs back then had AND. 

Mr Engel was good enough to publish flowcharts and a list of variables used. He was not so good at explaining what actual
portions of code did. I guess that was left up to the imagination of the person typing it in.

Mr Engel also suggested ways the programs in his book could be improved. I have done none of them, at this point in time.
It's just the basic (ha ha!) game. Which mostly works. Kind of.

I'm certain there's a problem with the flow of the whole thing, and there's at least two bugs that I know of. 
One, it's possible for there to be no adjacent rooms. The other is that you can't run from combat.

Personal note: All of this was done on the Haiku operating system (http://www.haiku-os.org). Code was entered using
Koder. A PDF of the "Simulating Simulations" book was viewed using Okular. And good old Terminal provided the 
rest.
